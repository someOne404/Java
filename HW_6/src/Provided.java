/**
 * CS 2110 Concurrency Assignment <br> <br>
 * 
 * Defined below are several abstract classes that define the backbone of an
 * elevator system. You are to extend these abstract classes, implementing 
 * the abstract methods such that all the Persons are delivered safely to their
 * destination floors.<br> <br>
 * 
 * Start by making classes that will extend the abstract classes here. Your classes
 * should be called: <br>
 *  - Elevator <br>
 *  - Button <br>
 *  - ElevatorController <br>
 * Add method stubs in your concrete classes for each of the abstract methods, and
 * go from there. Note that you should not need to import 'Provided'. Eclipse 
 * sometimes automatically imports it. Instead, when you refer to classes in Provided,
 * reference them as "Provided._____".<br> <br>
 * 
 * Read the comments in this file for instructions, advice, and hints on specific
 * classes and methods. <br> <br>
 * 
 * We strongly recommend that you implement the Elevator 'start()' method first! 
 * Try running the main method in this file after you do. You should see helpful
 * debug information in your output console. We recommend that you then proceed to 
 * complete the Button class, then the Elevator class, and finally the ElevatorController
 * class last. <br><br>
 * 
 * The abstract classes below include several public and protected fields. You may 
 * introduce more fields in your concrete implementations if you like, but you should
 * not need to; the provided fields are sufficient. Neglecting the provided fields
 * may cause tests to fail and/or debug information to be incorrect. <br><br>
 * 
 * We also recommend that you test your
 * implementation with various experimental parameters. Make sure your implementation
 * is thread-safe by trying high-speed, stressful parameters, like 'DELAY' = 5 and
 * 'TEST_DURATION' = 1. Make sure your implementation works with any number of elevators
 * and floors. You must utilize every elevator. <br> <br>
 * 
 * You should not make any changes to this file except for testing purposes. We 
 * will test your submission by running your classes with our version of this
 * file, so any changes you make will not be preserved during grading. Your
 * implementation must work with the provided code. <br><br>
 * 
 * This assignment assumes a simplified elevator system in which each floor only 
 * has a single button (not 'going-up' and 'going-down' buttons), and for testing 
 * purposes, each floor starts with only has a single person on it. Elevators
 * can only carry one person at a time. We do not expect you to implement the most
 * efficient solution, but your system should respond immediately to requests, and
 * every request must be fulfilled.
